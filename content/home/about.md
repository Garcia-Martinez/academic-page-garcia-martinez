# Biography

Hi! I am Javier García-Martínez, a spanish sociologist interested in the intersection between the studies of Science, Technology and Society, Cultural Studies and Feminist Theory. My actual work is divided in two areas.

On one hand, my research is focused on mental health from unusual perspectives. Sociology of the Body/Emotions and STS ANT (and Post-ANT) theories have been quite influential for my work. Online mental health cultures is my focus topic right now.

On the other hand, I'm quite interested in democratization processes in technoscience, from publications to how people articulate scientific knowledges in certain contexts.

I am very concerned about Open Science and so all my publications are freely available for downloading. All my work is published exclusively in Open Access journals.

Thank you for coming along and don't doubt to email me, even if it's just to say hi.
