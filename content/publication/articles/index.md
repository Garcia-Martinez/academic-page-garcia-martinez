Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Neoliberalism has comprehended the way to end conflict passes through work-capital and simultaneously keeps increasing workers productivity via the construction of a subject whose affections are assembled in relation with salary and consumer practices. Under the precepts of the human capital theory subjects rationally guide their decisions in terms of investment in order to increase the added value that may be produced, for the final purpose of improving their flux of income, such as how the self as enterprise is conceptualized. Consequently, the full disposition of the worker facing the enterprise logic allows his subjectivity to function under the illusio of neoliberal rationality.

Discourses transmitted from the distinct higher echelons of power have employed the techniques of positive psychology to generate a social imaginary where responsibility of deeds and failures rely upon each one of us; however, it has been developed through joyful affects so success lies in will. Optimism in the face of change. The use of individual’s joyful affects with the purpose that the workers operate under the business’ interests help raising the degree of slavery while not only attaining their voluntary submission, but the workers happily submitting to said slavery. On the other hand, sad affects keep operating as a menace of exclusion if the precepts of this new business logic aren’t followed.

This way going in depth into emerging hegemonic discourses from positive psychology and business management is done analysing the mechanisms whose purpose is using workers emotions in order to obtain the best efficiency as possible, establishing relationships of indissoluble domination." abstract_short = ""
